/* https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Terminology
 - Artist: An artist is generally a musician (or musician persona), group of musicians, or other
           music professional (like a producer or engineer). https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Artist
 - Artist Credits: Artist credits indicate who is the main credited artist (or artists) for releases,
          release groups, tracks and recordings, and how they are credited. https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Artist_Credits
 - Release Group: used to group several different releases into a single logical entity. Every
          release belongs to one, and only one release group. https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Group
 - Medium: physical, separate things you would get when you buy something in a record store.
          They are the individual CDs, vinyls, etc. https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Medium
 - Release / Date: The release date is the date in which a release was made available through some
          sort of distribution mechanism. https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release/Date
 - Recording: an entity which can be linked to tracks on releases. Each track must always be
          associated with a single recording, but a recording can be linked to any number
          of tracks. https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Recording
 - Track: is the way a recording is represented on a particular release https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Track
