# Notes about React Native

## Requirements

- Node 10+
- Expo CLI

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
expo init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

I got some errors during the installation of Expo with sudo. See this [issue](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/issues/412)
