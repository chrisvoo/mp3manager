### TODO list
- [x] Install Lerna and structure the project (2018-09-17)
- [ ] configure PM2
- [ ] Implement the server
  - [x] GraphQL server setup: `apollo-server`'s new version has some differences in its setup. [Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/graphql-playground.html) is always available in development, and always disabled with `NODE_ENV=production` (2018-09-17);
